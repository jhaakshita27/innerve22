# Innerve Event Landing page
An event page for IGDTUW's (my college) annual technical fest Innerve 2022 <br>
It was made for Innerve 2021 for my application for the post of Head coordinator in Innerve's Web Development team <br>
P.S.: I got selected and got a chance to work on the main event pages of Innerve <br>
This is an updated version for the same. <br>
It has a newsletter subscription feature, incorporated using mailchimp API. <br>
It also has a contact form that uses Formspree in the backed to contact the Innerve team with regard to any queries or message <br>
Techstacks used: Html, Css, Javascript, Jquery, Bootstrap, Node JS, Express JS, mailchimp API integration
